## Summary
This project aims to simulate a sensor-based car racing on a 100x100 grid track.  
The car reads a configurable number of cells ahead each step to avoid obstacles, use boost points, and make strategic moves against opponents.

The project is designed with a modular structure:  
- **Track module** → Defines the track and environmental features (obstacles, boost points, energy points).  
- **Car module** → Car properties, position, sensor reading, and movement functions.  
- **Strategy module** → Decision-making algorithms, risk assessment, and opportunity evaluation.  
- **Simulation module** → Race loop, car interactions, and result evaluation.

The project can be further developed in later stages with more complex algorithms such as pathfinding, Monte Carlo simulations, and reinforcement learning.

###  Recommendations:
- **main.cpp** → Keep it modular so that the simulation can be run for each section or development stage.  
- **include/** and **src/** → Standard C++ project structure, makes it easy to scale.  
- **tests/** → Quickly validate the correctness of your code at each development stage.  
- **docs/** → Useful for explaining AI or advanced algorithms in later stages.
